# highlander

Highlander is taking on the "lightings" of data at high speeds and stores this data with the speed that the data store feels comfortable with.

It is quite simple really:  "Non Blocking I/O" => "Queue" => "Data Store"

Where the "Queue" and the "Data Store" pieces are pluggable, and "Non blocking I/O" is [Netty|http://netty.io/].

By default Highlander runs on "Netty" => "ZeroMQ" => "Redis"
with an option to swap out "ZeroMQ" with a [Single Write Principle Queue|http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2011/09/single-writer-principle.html]

####_TODO: since a data store (store [thing]) and a queue (produce/consume) are just functions, give an example on how to plug "your own"_

## Usage

Since "ZeroMQ" is a default queuing mechanism, and Highlander is JVM (Clojure), ZeroMQ [libraries|http://www.zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software] and [Java bindings|http://www.zeromq.org/bindings:java] need to be installed, in order for Highlander to run.

Running it from sources is really simple (that's how we roll in Clojure Universe):

```bash
$ lein run
```

Once it is up and running, you should see:
```
INFO: highlander is ready for the lightning {:host 0.0.0.0 :port 4242 }
```

and of course the usage:
```bash

INFO: Usage:

 Switches          Default             Desc
 --------          -------             ----
 -h, --host        0.0.0.0             start on this hostname
 -p, --port        4242                listen on this port
 -zq, --zqueue     inproc://zhulk.ipc  use this zmq queue
 -q, --queue       zmq                 queue type [e.g. zmq, swpq]
 -qc, --qcapacity  33554432            queue capacity. used for JVM queues
 -mi, --monterval  5                   queue monitor interval
```

### Swapping Qs

As you can see from the usage in order to use a Single Write Principle queue instead of ZeroMQ, you can do:

```
$ lein run -q swpq
```

which will reflect that on the startup:

```
...
INFO: [swpq]: single write principle queue is ready to roll
...
```

### Peeking Inside the Q

While a "Data Store" allows you to easily peek inside, queues are different. For example ZeroMQ does not allow you to do that, hence the Highlander has a Q monitor built in that gives basic throughput visibility as the data is streaming in:

```bash
       message rate: 329552.2 msg/s
      current depth: 143428
 pass through total: 7939711
```

### Exporting LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Before running the highlander, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` needs to be exported to let the server know where to find zmq C++ libs:
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
```


### Q Pusher

There is a bench playground that has a basic Java NIO streamer, as well as a Q Pusher, which allows to take Netty and Data Store out of the picture to just focus on Q numbers. It can be run as:

```bash
$ lein run -m bench.qpusher
```

```bash
INFO: Usage:

 Switches          Default         Desc
 --------          -------         ----
 -zq, --zqueue     inproc://zhulk  use this zmq queue
 -q, --queue       zmq             queue type (e.g. zmq, swpq)
 -n, --number      100000000       number of things
 -qc, --qcapacity  33554432        queue capacity. used for JVM queues
 -mi, --monterval  5               queue monitor interval
```

By default it is ZeroMQ, but it can be switched to another queue (e.g. Single Write Principle):

```
$ lein run -m bench.qpusher -q swpq
```
